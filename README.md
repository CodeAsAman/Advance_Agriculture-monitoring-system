# Advance_Agriculture-monitoring-system
This is an iot based smart agriculture based monitoring project .
It help farmers to understand the need of water and fertilizers of plants. So that farmers can save unwanted amount of fertilizer and water and save expenses on crop.
Agriculture is the primary occupation in our country for ages. Agriculture is an 
integral part of Indian economy. Over 60% of Indian population based upon agriculture and 
one third of the income of nation arises from agricultural practices. Hence it plays a vital role 
in the development of the country. Nearly 42% of workforce is employed in agriculture but 
still it contributes to 17% to our GDP.
Bundelkhand is one of the challenging place in India for farmers to practice 
agriculture. Bundelkhand region, spread over 70,000 sq.km in 13 districts of Uttar Pradesh 
and Madhya Pradesh, was continuously facing drought 2003 and 2010, floods in 2011, late 
monsoon and deficit rain in 2012 and 2013, and a second spell of drought in 2014 and this 
has been since ages. The problem faced by this area are erratic rainfall, severe drought, water 
unavailability, lack of technical equipment and investments unavailability to farmers .These 
issues related to farming is continuously hampering the development of the country. 
Possible solution for these problems is to opt for modernized agriculture that 
comprises of modern trends. Hence, agriculture can be made smart using IoT and other 
technologies. We have used IoT in agriculture which allows connections of all devices across 
field to measure the soil moisture, soil pH, soil temperature, soil NPK, air humidity, and air 
temperature. We have deployed sensors in the field to collect the data of the soil parameters 
and further, transfer this data on cloud and website through a wireless protocol. We have 
compared the collected data with the standard data set and identify the defects /deficiency. If 
there is any defect in the crop it will send notification to the respected mobile/PC. After 
getting the notification, farmers can add supplements (fertilizers, urea, nitrogen, phosphorous, 
potassium). It will get high yield variety of crops qualitatively and quantitatively.
Finally, based on this thorough review, we identify current and future trends of IoT in 
agriculture and highlight potential research challenges. This concept is created as a product 
and given to the farmerâ€™s welfare
